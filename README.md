# SummaryLlama

## Overview
**SummaryLlama** is a text summarization tool that leverages LLaMA-based models to generate concise and meaningful summaries of long-form text. The project is designed to help users process textual data efficiently while maintaining key information.

## Features
- ✅ **LLaMA-based Summarization** – Uses advanced transformer models for accurate text summarization.
- ✅ **Customizable Summaries** – Adjust summary length and focus.
- ✅ **Preprocessing** – ncludes tokenization for handling textual data.


## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Primary programming language.
- **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)** – The core model used for summarization.
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – To load and interact with the LLaMA model.
- **PyTorch** – Deep learning framework for model fine-tuning.
